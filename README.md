# NetworkX, Matplotlib, and NumPy Libraries

## Overview

These libraries are essential tools in the Python scientific computing ecosystem, offering capabilities for network analysis, data visualization, and numerical computations.

- **NetworkX**: A powerful library for creating, manipulating, and studying complex networks or graphs. It provides various algorithms for network analysis and graph visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: A cornerstone library for generating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It offers a wide range of plot types and customization options.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental foundation for scientific computing in Python. It provides efficient multidimensional arrays and mathematical functions, enabling high-performance numerical operations.

# Description

## Introduction
The algorithm constructs a path through a graph representation of a chessboard. This path demonstrates the legal movements of a specified chess piece, ensuring that each square is visited at most once.

The graph depicts the legal connections between squares on a chessboard. A knight's movement follows a specific pattern: it traverses either two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or vice versa, forming an "L" shape.

The bishop chess piece moves in any direction diagonally. Chess rules state that there is no limit to the number of squares a bishop can travel on the chessboard, as long as there is not another piece obstructing its path.
