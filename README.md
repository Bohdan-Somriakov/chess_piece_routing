# NetworkX, Matplotlib, and NumPy Libraries

## Overview

These libraries are essential tools in the Python scientific computing ecosystem, offering capabilities for network analysis, data visualization, and numerical computations.

- **NetworkX**: A powerful library for creating, manipulating, and studying complex networks or graphs. It provides various algorithms for network analysis and graph visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: A cornerstone library for generating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It offers a wide range of plot types and customization options.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental foundation for scientific computing in Python. It provides efficient multidimensional arrays and mathematical functions, enabling high-performance numerical operations.

# Description

## Introduction
The algorithm constructs a path through a graph representation of a chessboard. This path demonstrates the legal movements of a specified chess piece, ensuring that each square is visited at most once.

The graph depicts the legal connections between squares on a chessboard. A knight's movement follows a specific pattern: it traverses either two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or vice versa, forming an "L" shape.
